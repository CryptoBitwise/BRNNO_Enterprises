## üß™ Testing the Complete Service Management Flow

### Prerequisites
- Your BRNNO API server is running on `http://localhost:3001`
- You have a database set up with the users and services tables
- You have a valid JWT token from logging in (see `TESTING_GUIDE.md`)

## üõ†Ô∏è Testing with Different Tools

### Using Postman

1. **Set up environment variables:**
   - `base_url`: `http://localhost:3001`
   - `token`: Your JWT token from login
   - `service_id`: (will be set after creating a service)

2. **Create requests for each endpoint above**
3. **Use the "Authorization" tab** with "Bearer Token" type
4. **Use environment variables** like `{{base_url}}/api/v1/services`

### Using Insomnia

1. **Set up environment variables** similar to Postman
2. **Create requests** for each endpoint
3. **Use the "Auth" tab** with "Bearer Token" type

### Using curl (Command Line)

```bash
# 1. Create a service
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/services \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Full Detail Package",
    "description": "Complete interior and exterior detailing",
    "price": 149.99,
    "duration_minutes": 180
  }'

# 2. Get all services
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/v1/services \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"

# 3. Get specific service (replace SERVICE_ID)
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/v1/services/SERVICE_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"

# 4. Update service (replace SERVICE_ID)
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3001/api/v1/services/SERVICE_ID \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Premium Full Detail Package",
    "price": 199.99
  }'

# 5. Delete service (replace SERVICE_ID)
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3001/api/v1/services/SERVICE_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

## üîç Validation Testing

### Test Required Fields

Try creating a service without required fields:

```bash
# Missing name
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/services \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "description": "Complete detailing",
    "price": 149.99
  }'
```

**Expected Response (400 Bad Request):**
```json
{
  "error": "Service name is required"
}
```

### Test Price Validation

```bash
# Negative price
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/services \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Test Service",
    "price": -50.00
  }'
```

**Expected Response (400 Bad Request):**
```json
{
  "error": "Price must be a positive number"
}
```

### Test Duration Validation

```bash
# Invalid duration
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/services \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Test Service",
    "price": 100.00,
    "duration_minutes": -30
  }'
```

**Expected Response (400 Bad Request):**
```json
{
  "error": "Duration must be a positive number"
}
```

## üîç Security Testing

### Test Without Authentication

Try accessing any service endpoint without the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/v1/services
```

**Expected Response (401 Unauthorized):**
```json
{
  "error": "Access token required"
}
```

### Test with Invalid Token

Try accessing with an invalid token:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/v1/services \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer invalid_token_here"
```

**Expected Response (403 Forbidden):**
```json
{
  "error": "Invalid or expired token"
}
```

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Access token required"**
   - Make sure you're including the `Authorization` header
   - Ensure the token format is `Bearer YOUR_TOKEN`

2. **"Service not found or access denied"**
   - The service ID might be incorrect
   - The service might belong to a different user
   - The service might have been deleted

3. **"Service name is required"**
   - Make sure you're sending the `name` field in the request body
   - Check that the JSON is properly formatted

4. **"Service price is required"**
   - Make sure you're sending the `price` field in the request body
   - Price must be a number, not a string

5. **"Price must be a positive number"**
   - Ensure the price is a number (not a string)
   - Ensure the price is greater than or equal to 0

6. **"Duration must be a positive number"**
   - Ensure duration_minutes is a number (not a string)
   - Ensure duration_minutes is greater than 0

7. **"User not authenticated"**
   - Your JWT token might have expired (tokens expire after 8 hours)
   - Try logging in again to get a fresh token

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

Your service management system is working correctly if:

1. ‚úÖ You can create services with authentication (201 response)
2. ‚úÖ You can retrieve all services for the authenticated user (200 response)
3. ‚úÖ You can retrieve specific services by ID (200 response)
4. ‚úÖ You can update services (200 response)
5. ‚úÖ You can delete services (200 response)
6. ‚úÖ All endpoints reject requests without authentication (401 response)
7. ‚úÖ Users can only access their own services (proper isolation)
8. ‚úÖ Required field validation works (400 responses)
9. ‚úÖ Price and duration validation works (400 responses)

## üéØ Next Steps

Once testing is complete, you can:

1. **Add service categories/tags**
2. **Implement service search functionality**
3. **Add service availability scheduling**
4. **Create service packages/bundles**
5. **Add service reviews and ratings**
6. **Implement service analytics and reporting**

Your BRNNO API service management system is now complete and secure! üéØ

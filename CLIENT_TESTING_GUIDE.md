# BRNNO API Client Management Testing Guide

This guide will help you test the complete client management system using Postman, Insomnia, or curl commands.

## üß™ Testing the Complete Client Management Flow

### Prerequisites
- Your BRNNO API server is running on `http://localhost:3001`
- You have a database set up with the users and clients tables
- You have a valid JWT token from logging in (see `TESTING_GUIDE.md`)

## üõ†Ô∏è Testing with Different Tools

### Using Postman

1. **Set up environment variables:**
   - `base_url`: `http://localhost:3001`
   - `token`: Your JWT token from login
   - `client_id`: (will be set after creating a client)

2. **Create requests for each endpoint above**
3. **Use the "Authorization" tab** with "Bearer Token" type
4. **Use environment variables** like `{{base_url}}/api/v1/clients`

### Using Insomnia

1. **Set up environment variables** similar to Postman
2. **Create requests** for each endpoint
3. **Use the "Auth" tab** with "Bearer Token" type

### Using curl (Command Line)

```bash
# 1. Create a client
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/clients \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Acme Corporation",
    "email": "contact@acme.com",
    "phone": "+1-555-0123",
    "notes": "Major client for Q4 project"
  }'

# 2. Get all clients
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/v1/clients \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"

# 3. Get specific client (replace CLIENT_ID)
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/v1/clients/CLIENT_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"

# 4. Update client (replace CLIENT_ID)
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3001/api/v1/clients/CLIENT_ID \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Acme Corporation Ltd",
    "email": "info@acme.com"
  }'

# 5. Delete client (replace CLIENT_ID)
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3001/api/v1/clients/CLIENT_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

## üîç Security Testing

### Test Without Authentication

Try accessing any client endpoint without the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/v1/clients
```

**Expected Response (401 Unauthorized):**
```json
{
  "error": "Access token required"
}
```

### Test with Invalid Token

Try accessing with an invalid token:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/v1/clients \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer invalid_token_here"
```

**Expected Response (403 Forbidden):**
```json
{
  "error": "Invalid or expired token"
}
```

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Access token required"**
   - Make sure you're including the `Authorization` header
   - Ensure the token format is `Bearer YOUR_TOKEN`

2. **"Client not found or access denied"**
   - The client ID might be incorrect
   - The client might belong to a different user
   - The client might have been deleted

3. **"Client name is required"**
   - Make sure you're sending the `name` field in the request body
   - Check that the JSON is properly formatted

4. **"User not authenticated"**
   - Your JWT token might have expired (tokens expire after 8 hours)
   - Try logging in again to get a fresh token

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

Your client management system is working correctly if:

1. ‚úÖ You can create clients with authentication (201 response)
2. ‚úÖ You can retrieve all clients for the authenticated user (200 response)
3. ‚úÖ You can retrieve specific clients by ID (200 response)
4. ‚úÖ You can update clients (200 response)
5. ‚úÖ You can delete clients (200 response)
6. ‚úÖ All endpoints reject requests without authentication (401 response)
7. ‚úÖ Users can only access their own clients (proper isolation)

---

## üéØ Next Steps

Once testing is complete, you can:

1. **Add client search functionality**
2. **Implement client categories/tags**
3. **Add client contact history**
4. **Create client import/export features**
5. **Add client analytics and reporting**

Your BRNNO API client management system is now complete and secure! üéØ
